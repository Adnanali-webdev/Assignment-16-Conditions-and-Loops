Ans 1 ) Conditional statements in JavaScript are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. 
They allow your code to make decisions and execute different blocks of code depending on whether a condition evaluates to true or false.

type of conditional statement :-
if Statement
Basic Form: Executes code block if condition is true.
Syntax Example: if (condition) { // code block }

if-else Statement
Description: Executes code block if condition is true, otherwise executes an alternative code block.
Syntax Example: if (condition) { // code block } else { // alternative code block }

Nested if Statement
Description: if-else statements within another if-else statement.
Syntax Example: if (condition1) { if (condition2) { // code block } }

if else if Ladder
Description: Allows chaining multiple conditions together.
Syntax Example: if (condition1) { // code block } else if (condition2) { // code block }

switch statement
Description: Used when you have many exact matches (like menu options, days, etc.).
syntax Example : switch (Expression){
    case value1:
    // block of code 
    break;
    case value2 :
    // block of code
     break;
     default:
     //block of code
}

Ans 3) Loops are programming constructs that let you repeat a block of code multiple times, either a set number of times or until a condition is no longer true.
 They help automate repetitive tasks and make your code more efficient.

Why Do We Need Loops?
-> To avoid writing repetitive code

-> To process lists or arrays

-> To automate tasks like counting, checking, or generating data

-> To iterate over data structures like arrays, objects, or strings

1) for Loop
Use when you know how many times you want to loop.

Syntax:

for (initialization; condition; increment) {
  // code to run
}

2) while Loop
Use when you want to loop as long as a condition is true, but donâ€™t know how many times in advance.

Syntax:
while (condition) {
  // code to run
}

3)  do...while Loop
Similar to while, but runs the code at least once, even if the condition is false.

Syntax:
do {
  // code to run
} while (condition);

4) for...of Loop 
Used to iterate over iterables like arrays or strings.

Syntax:
for (let value of iterable) {
  // code to run
}

5) for...in Loop
Used to iterate over object properties.

Syntax:
for (let key in object) {
  // code to run
}
